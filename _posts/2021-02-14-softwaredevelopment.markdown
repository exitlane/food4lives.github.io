Our plan for development is to utilize Github as our repository. We already created an organization account called food4lives. Our work items will be tracked in Github and pull requests (PRs) will be created to incorporate our changes into the main branch. These pull requests will be reviewed and approved by other me
mbers of the team before merging. In evaluation, the team will test the application and volunteers can test during the beta release. We will also meet with our partner organization to gather feedback iteratively. For our deployment phase, we will work with the partner organization to deploy the apps to the app store. Overall, we plan to work in agile.
