For our initial design architecture, we are using Flutter for the frontend and AWS Amplify for the backend. AWS Amplify will be used for authentication, backend, and hosting the database. AWS Amplify also holds the schema for the data. Flutter will utilize the data held in Amplify and be used on the client side to create the UI for the app.
