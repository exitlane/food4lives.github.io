Food 4 Lives also works with local colleges and Universities to provide meals to the homeless; Emory University and Georgia Tech provide free meals to Food 4 Lives on a regular basis.   In addition, Food 4 Lives also partners with other local food banks and non profits to receive & redistribute food for the homeless.  Some of the non profit organizations that work with Food 4 Lives are MUST Ministries, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Rescuing Leftover Cuisine, Concrete Jungle, and Atlanta Mission. Additionally, Food 4 Lives is sponsored in part by Pepsi, UPS, and Global Power.  

As crucial as charitable donations are to the normal functioning of a food bank, it is imperative that Food 4 Lives maintains a consistent and meaningful supply of volunteers to effectively serve the needs of the homeless.   Food for Lives has on average about 100 volunteers a week;  Only 50% of these individual are returning volunteers.  Our partner believes that their less than ideal rate of volunteer retention is due largely to the shortcomings of their existing system for reaching out to the public.
